1) The code contains two files KR_project.ipnyb which contains the CNN model and gradio_KR.py which runs the GUI. 
2) The code was run on python 3.11.0 in Visual Studio Code on Windows
3) Ensure the Meta, Test and Train Folders and the meta.csv, train.csv and test.csv files are in the same folder as the KR_project.ipnyb and gradio_KR.py     files.
4) First run the entire KR_project.ipnyb file then run the gradio_KR.py file IN THAT ORDER.
The Following libraries need to be installed before running the codes:
• OpenCV
• NumPy 
• Pandas 
• TensorFlow
• Matplotlib
• Scikit-Learn
• Keras
• Pillow (PIL)
